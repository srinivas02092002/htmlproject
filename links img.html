      Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy (January 23, 1998 â€“ June 18, 2018), known
      professionally as XXXTentacion,[c] was an American rapper and
      singer-songwriter. Born in Plantation, Florida, XXXTentacion spent most of
      his childhood in Lauderhill. He began writing music after being released
      from a juvenile detention center and soon started his music career on
      SoundCloud in 2013, employing styles and techniques that were
      unconventional in rap music such as distortion and heavy guitar-backed
      instrumentals, drawing inspiration from third-wave emo and grunge. In
      2014, he formed the underground collective Members Only and, alongside
      other members of the collective, soon became a popular figure in
      SoundCloud rap, a trap music scene that takes elements of lo-fi music and
      harsh 808s. [17] XXXTentacion gained mainstream attention with his 2016
      single "Look at Me!". His debut studio album, 17 (2017), peaked at number
      two on the Billboard 200, while his second album, ? (2018), debuted atop
      the chart; both received triple platinum certifications by the Recording
      Industry Association of America (RIAA) .The latter's lead single, "Sad!",
      posthumously reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100[18] and had
      amassed more than 1.2 billion views on YouTube and 2.1 billion streams on
      Spotify by February 2024, in addition to having received diamond
      certification by the RIAA in August 2.
